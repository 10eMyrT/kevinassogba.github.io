    <p> A couple of months ago, I started a journey to strengthen my leadership skills for carreer success. Part of a university program, it has been an excellent trip to discover myself, examine my strengths, and evaluate my weaknesses. From  topics related to DISC styles, to Emotional Intelligence and Resilience, we discussed topics such as Personal Branding, Professionalism, Communication, Lollipop moments, etc. Among others, I now am convinced that Personal branding is key to success in many areas, thus have I decided to work on improving mine. </p>

    <p>Welcome to my blog, a means of communicating you my thoughts on certain topics. There is a large realm of subjects we could explore, and many would be expecting me to write about technical areas of Computer Science, Logistics Engineering and Transportation Engineering, but I would like to keep this space very simple. Let us embark together upon a journey on exploring topics closer to everyday life. Hope you would stick with me and leave your comments in a dialogue box which will be included below for further discussions.</p>

    <p>From this day onwards, I will prediodically post on a new subject, which I believe will interest you. You will find a list of the topics of my current posts on your left. Make sure to regularly visit this web page to read more, get insights about some of the challenging issues everyone faces, and aspects which improvement can contribute to a strong personal leadership development.</p>
