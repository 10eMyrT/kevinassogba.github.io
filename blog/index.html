<div class="container-fluid">
    <p> A couple of months ago, I started a journey to strengthen my leadership skills for carreer success. Part of a university program, it has been an excellent trip to dig my inner-self, examine my strengths, and evaluate my weaknesses, which I discovered are more than I thought. From  the recognition of my DISC styles, to Emotional Intelligence, we discussed topics such as Personal Branding, Professionalism, learning to create lollipop moments, etc. Among other things which I have discovered, Personal branding is key to success in many areas, and I have decided to work on improving mine. Hope you would not mind following me on this journey to improve others perception of us, even without personally knowing us. </p>

    <p>From this day onwards, I will prediodically post on a new subject, which I believe will interest you. You will find a list of the topics of my current posts on your left. Make sure to regularly visit my website to read more about what I do, get insights about some of the challenging issues developpers face both on their projects, and in their personal leadership development.</p>
