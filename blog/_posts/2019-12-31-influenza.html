<h2> Welcome to</h2> <h4>{{page.title}}</h4>
<hr>

<p>For decades, health and human well-being have been addressed by the world leaders at
many occasions willing to improve living conditions of human race on earth. Extensive research,
discoveries and advances are being made to prevent many of existing mass diseases and cure
others, but seasonal diseases remain a great challenge for medical experts and decision makers.
As defined by the third goal of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, “Good
health and well-being” is an indicator of a sustainable development[1], and therefore, draws
attention on the importance of healthy inhabitants for a country’s development.</p>

<p>As most dynamic systems, Influenza A & B, generically called “flu”, evolves and spreads
rapidly. Although immunization, screening, and the enforcement of some vaccines are effective
ways to control, the awareness of the population on the relationship between their environment
and the contamination of the disease would efficiently contribute to reducing the number of
infected people.</p>

<p>Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has a broad application in healthcare and is
used for purposes varying from disease hot-spot analysis, optimal healthcare facility location, to
drugs dispatch routing[5-6]. Many researchers have provided several ways of using different GIS
tools, and developed advanced frameworks on how to conduct both experiments and analyses.
Graves[7] proposed an extensive review of literature on GIS and healthcare access.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project is to apply Geographical Information Systems (GIS) tools to provide the spatial relational schema between different type of city climate and geography and habitat layouts, and the spread of Influenza A & B in New York State. GIS has a broad application in healthcare and is used for purposes varying from disease hot-spot analysis, optimal healthcare facility location, to drugs dispatch routing. This project used GIS tools like “Definition query”, “Add data”, “Hillshade”, “layout”, “raster calculator”, and layers such as Elevation, Roads, wind speed, parcels. <p> <b>Goal: </b> Solution approach to United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3: “Good health and well-being”.</p>

<h4 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">GIS based analysis</h4>

<p>Influenza viruses are of four categories A, B, C, and D. While type-C is not very
common, and type-D is not know to infect people, type-A and type-B are seasonal infectious
diseases which spread rapidly[8]. These types of viruses spread through behaviors like close
contact with sick people, coughing in hands, touching eyes, nose and mouth with infected
hands[9].</p>

<p>For the purpose of this project, two cities in New York State have been chosen: Rochester
city and Ithaca city. The selection of these places originates from the analysis of data
representing their infection rates, as shown in Figure 1, and the availability of GIS-friendly data
for each city in New York State. At first sight, it is clearly observable that Rochester city, seat of
Monroe county is a highly infected area, compared to Ithaca city, seat of Tompkins county.
Therefore, the analysis of each city could lead to possible reasons supporting the rate of inflected
people.</p>

<p>In addition to the infection rate in both cities, the layers used in the GIS analysis are as
following:
    <ul style="padding-left: 50px">
        <li>Elevation: This layer consists in the digital elevation model of the city, and allows to
        observe the land patterns of each city, thereby comparing the size of population in contact
        with high wind speed.</li>
        <li>Wind speed: This layer is used to observe the speed of wind going through each city.</li>
        <li>Parcels: This layer allows to evaluate the demography of each city and obtain the size of
        the population per area of the city.</li>
        <li>Roads: This layer is used to validate the parcels data and evaluate the commute habits of
        the population.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Integrating the aforementioned layers, three different maps are generated for analysis and
comparison purposes. Figure 2 provides an initial overview of the wind speed over NYS, and could lead to infer that the difference between the rates of Influenza infection in Rochester and Ithaca is due to the
speed of wind. However, we can observe that New York city also possess a high rate of infection
but relatively low speed of wind. Therefore, further variables should be taken into account.</p>

<p>Figure 3 and Figure 4 respectively display Rochester city and Ithaca city with population,
transportation, wind speed and elevation layers. Observations yielded from the two maps can be summarized as following: the majority of Rochester city population lives on a high elevation
land, submerged by a relatively higher speed wind, whereas the majority of Ithaca city
population lives on a low elevation land with an average wind speed lower than in Rochester
city.</p>

<p>GIS is a powerful tool which has a lot of application in healthcare. This project used GIS
tools like “Definition query”, “Add data”, “Hillshade”, “layout”, “raster calculator” in order to
evaluate correlative patterns between a city’s habitats, roads, wind speed, elevation, and the
spread of Influenza types A and B in New York State. Following the analysis of generated maps,
we can conclude that the population living in high elevation places where there is considerable
frequency of high speed wind are more likely to be exposed to Influenza A and B.
Nevertheless, few factors among those susceptible to propel Influenza’s expansion are
considered in this project. Therefore, further analysis are required in order to confirm the current
result.</p>
