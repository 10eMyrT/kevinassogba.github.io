<h2> Welcome to</h2> <h4>{{page.title}}</h4>
<hr>

<p>
    I would like to start this series of blogs by talking about personal development for carreer success. As you might have seen on my home page, I am a personal development enthusiast, and these are topics which are dear to my hear. I believe it is not a feature that is just turned on by aging, but a means to establish oneself as an influencer in the world. <b>YOU</b> is very important, and how you shape yourself can define how well you do at work, in familly, among friends, and even with foreigners you meet in the streets. Among other values which can assist every human-being achieve a high level in his development, <b>Personal branding</b>, <b>Communication</b> and <b>Emotional Intelligence</b> are important points on which I would like to entertain you on.

<h4 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Personal branding</h4>

<p>
    Every decision either in our private life or in a group impacts our personal brand. Personal branding can become a vehicle for professionalism depending on how we brand ourself. Features such as “the tone”, “the wording”, “the discussions we take part in”, “how fast we reply”, etc., if displayed properly will send a signal to others on our degree of responsibility and professionalism. Therefore, a proper branding is manifests a higher deegree of professionalism, whereas an inappropriate branding causes more harm to ones image.

<h4 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Communication</h4>

<p>
    Effective communication is an important factor in planning, organizing, leading any organization, and an essential tool for the prevention and the management of conflicts. A good decision can be taken not just from one’s intuition, it requires listening, connections and collaboration through effective communication. The latter can be developed through open mindedness, confidence, listening, friendliness, feedback and using non verbal cues. This results in strong decision making, more productivity, developing strong business relations, receiving better response from all stakeholders and ability to solve problem quickly.

<h4 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Emotional Intelligence & Resilience</h4>

<p>
    Our perception of the world is impacted by our emotions, and reality is not always as viewed. As human-beings, we have different ways of understanding and addressing situations we face, and while a positive mindset is the strength of some, others tend to accept events in a negative fashion. Different materials about Resilience and Emotional Intelligence highlight a strong correlation between positivity, happiness, and performance, success. In life, we tend to let success define our happiness, leading us to keep raising our expectations and exposing us to a higher level of deception, negativity and failure. However, for prosperity, we need a definite change of equation and take happiness as a means to success instead of the opposite. We need to increase our emotional intelligence, train our brains to scan for and absorb positivity and avoid viewing the world through the lens of negativity. Nevertheless, Emotional Intelligence is not being positive to the extend of agreeing with everything, but knowing when and how exercise caution, self-awareness and self-regulation. It takes a human-being to think about oneself, but a leader to think about others. Let us increase our EI by absorbing positivity, thinking about others, and taking happiness as a driver to success, not its result.
