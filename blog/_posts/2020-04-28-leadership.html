<p>
    I would like to start this series of blogs by talking about personal development for carreer success. As you might have seen on my home page, I am a personal development enthusiast, and these topics are dear to my heart. Personal development is not a feature which can just be turned on, but a well-oiled mechanism meant to establish oneself as an influencer in the World. "<b>YOU</b>" is a very important variable that defines our existence, and how you present yourself can define how well you do at work, in familly, among friends, and even with foreigners you meet in the streets. <b>Personal branding</b>, <b>Communication</b> and <b>Emotional Intelligence</b> are important aspects which improvement can propel the achievement of a high level of development. I a few words, I would like to share my point of view about each of them, and hope the following analysis could trigger your willingness to work on any of those topics.

<h5 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Personal branding</h5>

<p>
    Every decision either in our private life or in a group impacts our personal brand. Personal branding can become a vehicle for professionalism depending on how we brand ourself. Features such as “tone”, “wording”, “discussions we take part in”, “how fast we reply”, etc., if displayed properly will send a signal to others on our degree of responsibility and professionalism.A proper branding supports a higher degree of professionalism, whereas an inappropriate branding causes more harm to ones image.

<h5 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Communication</h5>

<p>
    Effective communication is an important factor in planning, organizing, leading, and an essential tool for the prevention and the management of conflicts. A good decision is made not just from one’s intuition, but requires listening, analysis, discussions, collaboration, and effective communication. The latter can be developed through open mindedness, confidence, listening, friendliness, feedback and using non verbal cues. This results in strong decision making, more productivity, developing strong business relations, receiving better response from all stakeholders and the ability to solve problems quickly.

<h5 class="text-secondary text-uppercase mb-0">Emotional Intelligence & Resilience</h5>

<p>
    Our perception of the world is impacted by our emotions, and reality is not always as viewed. As human-beings, we have different ways of understanding and addressing situations we face, and while a positive mindset is the strength of some, others tend to accept events in a negative fashion. Different materials about Resilience and Emotional Intelligence highlight a strong correlation between positivity, happiness, performance, and success. In life, we tend to let success define our happiness, leading us to keep raising our expectations and exposing us to a higher level of deception, negativity and failure. However, for prosperity, we need a definite change of equation and take happiness as a means to success instead of the opposite. We need to increase our emotional intelligence, train our brains to scan for and absorb positivity and avoid viewing the world through the lens of negativity. Nevertheless, Emotional Intelligence is not being positive to the extend of agreeing with everything, but knowing when and how to exercise caution, self-awareness and self-regulation. It takes a human-being to think about oneself, but a leader to think about others. Let us increase our EI by absorbing positivity, thinking about others, and taking happiness as a driver to success, not its result.
