A business related dataset from Yelp has been selected, analyzed, preprocessed and reproduced as a database, which is implemented for a better management of current and future data entries. MySQL Workbench and Netbeans were respectively used as database software and for the design of a Graphical User Interface. In its final form, the database is able to handle queries based on the users selection returning information about Restaurant. Beauty and Adult Entertainment type businesses based on their location, number of stars or wheelchair accessibility. A basic or detailed report options are given to the user to customize the type of information he/she is looking for. A picture of the designed GUI with Netbeans is given below. Key steps in the design process can be summarized as follows:
          <ul>
              <li>Creation of the corresponding ER diagram and design of a relational schema</li>
              <li>Normalization of collected data following constraints of the BCNF standards</li>
              <li>Creation and population of tables with the normalized data</li>
              <li>Generation queries for database validation tests</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
