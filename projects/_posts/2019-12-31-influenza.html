GIS has a broad application in healthcare and is used for purposes varying from disease hot-spot analysis, optimal healthcare facility location, to drugs dispatch routing. This project used GIS tools like “Definition query”, “Add data”, “Hillshade”, “layout”, “raster calculator”, and layers such as Elevation, Roads, wind speed, parcels. <p> <b>Goal: </b> Solution approach to United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3: “Good health and well-being”.</p>
